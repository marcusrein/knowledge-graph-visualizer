# üõ∞ Geo Genesis + GRC-20 Starter Kit (based on Scaffold-ETH 2)

This monorepo is a full-stack starter kit that lets you **upload knowledge to The Graph's GRC-20 standard on the Geo Genesis testnet** and compete on a fully on-chain contribution leaderboard.

It provides a hands-on-template for developers looking to build applications using the GRC-20 SDK.

## How it Works

The main page (`/`) provides an interactive demo:
1.  **Create Knowledge**: A user enters a name and description for a new knowledge "entity".
2.  **Publish to IPFS**: The app uses the `@graphprotocol/grc-20` SDK to format the data, then sends it to a lightweight backend server which pins the content to IPFS.
3.  **Log Contribution On-Chain**: After the data is on IPFS, the user is prompted to send a transaction to the `ContributionTracker` smart contract. This awards them 1 point for their contribution.
4.  **View Leaderboard**: The `/leaderboard` page reads events directly from the `ContributionTracker` contract to display a real-time, on-chain leaderboard of top contributors.

## Key Components

*   **Frontend** (Next.js ‚Äì `packages/nextjs`)
    *   **`/` (Home Page)**: An interactive demo and tutorial for publishing knowledge.
    *   **`/leaderboard`**: A fully on-chain leaderboard that reads contract events.
*   **Backend** (Express ‚Äì `packages/backend`)
    *   **`POST /api/upload`**: A simple endpoint that takes GRC-20 `ops` and uses the SDK to publish them to IPFS.
*   **Smart Contracts** (Hardhat ‚Äì `packages/hardhat`)
    *   **`ContributionTracker.sol`**: A simple contract to log contribution points for each user via a `reportContribution()` function and `ContributionReported` event.
    *   **Hardhat-Deploy script**: Deploys `ContributionTracker` to the target network.
*   **Custom Chain Config**: Includes the Geo Genesis testnet (chainId **19411**) in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

## Quickstart

To get started with this starter kit, follow the steps below:

1.  **Clone and Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <repo-name>
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Run the Local Blockchain**:
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    yarn chain
    ```
    This starts a local Hardhat network.

3.  **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
    In a second terminal, deploy the `ContributionTracker` contract:
    ```bash
    yarn deploy
    ```

4.  **Start the Backend Server**:
    In a third terminal, start the backend server for IPFS uploads:
    ```bash
    cd packages/backend
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  **Start the Frontend App**:
    In a fourth terminal, start the Next.js frontend:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

Now, visit your app at `http://localhost:3000`. You can test the full flow of creating knowledge and seeing your address appear on the on-chain leaderboard.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Test It Yourself (5-minute guide)

Want to verify the flow or show it to a teammate? Follow these exact steps in **three separate terminals** (they work on macOS / Linux / WSL / Codespaces):

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
yarn install

# 2. Terminal A ‚Äì local Ethereum chain
yarn chain

# 3. Terminal B ‚Äì deploy contracts (runs only once per chain start)
yarn deploy

# 4. Terminal C ‚Äì backend + frontend in watch-mode
# (make sure you are at the **repo root**, not inside a package)
# backend (handles IPFS uploads + SQLite DB)
yarn backend:start
# open a second tab in the same terminal for the frontend or open a **Terminal D**
yarn start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, connect a wallet, and try:
1. Creating a new Knowledge Category.
2. Adding knowledge values to it.
3. Watching your address appear on `/leaderboard`.

### Environment variables

The project works out-of-the-box for local usage. If you want on-chain tracking on Sepolia you can copy `.env.example` to `.env` (backend) and fill in:

```env
TRACKER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<address of ContributionTracker on Sepolia>
PRIVATE_KEY=<dev wallet with some Sepolia ETH for gas>
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<your RPC, e.g. from Alchemy>
```

You can still play with the UI without these values ‚Äì the on-chain tracker call is skipped if they are missing.

### Common gotchas

* **SQLite read-only** ‚Äì if you see `SQLITE_READONLY: attempt to write a readonly database`, delete the local DB and let the backend recreate it:
  ```bash
  yarn reset
  ```
  (or simply `rm -rf packages/backend/data`)
* **Port already in use** ‚Äì stop any lingering hardhat / backend / frontend processes before rerunning.
* **Need a clean slate?** ‚Äì see the full reset instructions at the end of this README (`yarn fresh-start`).

Happy hacking! üöÄ

## Resetting / Cleaning Local Data

Need a fresh start for a demo or testing? The repository ships with helper scripts for different levels of reset:

### Option 1: Quick Local Reset (keeps existing space)

Wipes the local SQLite database **and nothing else**:

```bash
# Stop the backend if it's running first
yarn reset           # removes packages/backend/data/leaderboard.db
```

To fully reset the app, also clear the UI's cached space id in your browser console and reload the page:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('personalSpaceId');
location.reload();
```

The backend will recreate an empty database automatically on the next boot, and you'll continue using your existing personal space.

### Option 2: Complete Fresh Start (new space + clean local data)

For a completely clean slate with a brand-new personal space on The Graph:

```bash
yarn fresh-start 0xYourWalletAddress [Optional Space Name] [TESTNET|MAINNET]
```

This script will:
1. Delete the local SQLite database
2. Create a new personal space on Geo Genesis 
3. Write the new space ID to `.env.local` for future reference
4. Output the new space ID to console

Example usage:
```bash
yarn fresh-start 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
yarn fresh-start 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 "My Demo Space"
yarn fresh-start 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 "Production Space" MAINNET
```

After running either script, restart your backend and frontend to see the changes take effect.
