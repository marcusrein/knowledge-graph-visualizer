# Knowledge Graph App - Todo List

## Completed âœ…
- [x] **Backend Setup** - SQLite + Next.js API routes for entities/relations/calendar
- [x] **Frontend Graph** - React Flow canvas with date picker, add nodes, connect nodes  
- [x] **Wallet Integration** - Lightweight wagmi + injected connector (no RainbowKit)
- [x] **Intro Modal** - Welcome modal with "don't show again" (localStorage)
- [x] **Basic Styling** - Tailwind + DaisyUI working, modal redesigned for contrast

## Pending ðŸš§
- [ ] **Snapshot System** - Daily reset logic + snapshots table and retrieval for calendar

- Desktop-focused (browser extension wallets only)
- No external dependencies (no WalletConnect cloud)
